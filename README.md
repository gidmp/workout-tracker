# [Workout Tracker](https://ancient-savannah-64833.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
Workout Tracker is a full-stack web app that enables user to keep track of their exercise progress.
User can add and then view their workout progress in their dashboard to see their workout status.

This app was made with mongoDB as its theme. My task is to take the pre-built HTML, CSS and JS
and create the back-end connection to the server and mongoDB database using mongoose.
